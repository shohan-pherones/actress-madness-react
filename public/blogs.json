    "body": "You can disagree with me, but I think there are a lot of things to say about this week’s pop releases when Ava Max drops the hottest song by far. Am I being a little unfair? Cards, on the table, in the past, I haven’t been the biggest fan of the global pop sensation. How can Ava change that around for me? Does the answer lie with the new single “Maybe You’re The Problem,” the first taste of Max’s highly anticipated second album? In truth, Ava has batted off a lot of flack from the critics and cynics."

    "body": "Hello, Peter! The internet has gone stark raving mad dissecting the first trailer for Spider-Man No Way Home, for easter eggs. We're less interested in trying to figure it out (we like to be surprised!) and more in what it's promising us. The familiar Tom Holland/Zendaya chemistry, mystical mayhem courtesy of Doctor Strange, and an attempt to relive the glory days of Sam Raimi's original Spidey trilogy (2002-2007)."
